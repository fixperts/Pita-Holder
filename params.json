Design File for use in laser cutter\r\n  * Found at the [Pita Holder repository](https://github.com/fixperts/Pita-Holder/)\r\n2. Friendly Makerspace or FabLab\r\n3. 3mm thick Acrylic (Plexiglas) sheet in the colour you want\r\n  * Note that the Makerspace or FabLab may be able to sell you one of these\r\n4. Items for mould creation if you wish to use a mould to shape the holder\r\n  * the list of things required [can be found here](#things-for-mould)\r\n\r\nYou need to take the file to the Makerspace and then ask them to cut it out of the acrylic sheet with a laser cutter.\r\n\r\nThis will then give you something that looks like:\r\n\r\nNow take off the sticky plastic backing from the holder. We now need to bend this piece of plastic into shape.\r\n\r\nThis is best done using a mould. If you wish to do it without a mould skip to [creating the finished piece](#bend-to-shape)\r\n\r\n### Instructions on creating a mould\r\n\r\n<a name=\"things-for-mould\"></a>Tools you will need:\r\n\r\n1. A Polypropylene sheet 46cm x 46cm in size\r\n2. A pair of scissors\r\n3. A ruler\r\n4. A permanent marker\r\n5. Duct tape\r\n6. A 2x30cm metal sheet\r\n7. A 2 litre bowl\r\n8. 1kg of plaster powder\r\n9. Mixing tool such as a spoon or a stick\r\n\r\n### Making the mould\r\n\r\n1. Cut a piece of Polypropylene (PP) sheet to the size shown in the diagram:\r\n  * All radii are 30cm long. \r\n  * There is 48cm distance between the farthest radii. \r\n  * There is a 16cm distance between each radius\r\n2. Fold the PP sheet into thirds without creasing it at the markings. (hold it rolled like and ellipsoid cone)\r\n3. Put a piece of duct tape at the tip of the cone.\r\n4. Put duct tape on all the edges to hold the cone and seal it for when we pour the wet plaster.\r\n\r\n### Making the plaster for the mould\r\n\r\n1. Take the piece of 2x30cm metal and use it to squeeze the cone so the top is 7cm wide.\r\n2. Fill up almost half the bowl with water\r\n3. Get someone to help you, this part should be quick:\r\n  * Slowly add the plaster powder to the water, try to pour evenly until the plaster reaches the surface of the water.\r\n9. Stir the mixture with the spoon for a minute or so, until it seems homogeneous.\r\n\r\n### Making the cone\r\n\r\n1. One person should hold the cone upright and the other person quickly pours the mixture into the cone.\r\n2. Hold it for a few minutes until it hardens or find something to lean it on.\r\n3. Wait for an hour until the casting hardens completely - it will warm-up and then cool down again.\r\n4. Mark the centre of the cone.\r\n5. The mould is ready to be used.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"bend-to-shape\"></a>Instructions on bending the plastic to shape\r\n\r\n1. Heat up an oven (work oven, not a food oven) to the maximum\r\n2. **USE GLOVES** : Check every few minutes to see if it's soft when you try to lift it up. If you start to see bubbles it is too hot - take it out immediately!\r\n3.  **USE GLOVES** : Do this quickly before the plastic cools down and hardens\r\n4. Bend the plastic to shape\r\n  a. 1st person should hold the mould\r\n  b. 2nd person presses the plexiglass against the mould\r\n  c. While still holding the plexiglass the same way, the lower part of the plexiglass should be pressed against the table to the desired angle.\r\n  d. Wait in that posture for a minute to let it cool down in the desired shape.\r\n\r\n### Final Product\r\n\r\nThe final product should then look something like:\r\n\r\n\r\nHave Fun!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
